# This project is used for timers purpose. For eg you are working for some hours so this software will give you break after each 20 minutes for  5 minutes and after sometime it will give you break for 25 mins

    # Its the logic to display the time and seconds as the stopwatch if ou dont understand this logic than just open the calculator and modulo calculator and start from 5*60 which we had passed in start_timer() function

    # We are using floor function because after dividing we dont our result in point
    minutes = math.floor(time / 60)
    seconds = time % 60

    # This two lines of codes will add '0' in before the single digit number for eg when the seconds are 10 then after '10' '9' will come but we want to show '09' and not only '9' so this two lines of code will be helpful. If you dont understand this 2 lines of code then just comment it and see the results
